Deploying a web app:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python?tabs=flask%2Cwindows%2Cvscode-aztools%2Cvscode-deploy%2Cdeploy-instructions-azportal%2Cterminal-bash%2Cdeploy-instructions-zip-azcli#2---create-a-web-app-in-azure

Steps:
1. Install Azure extensions
2. Create a folder & workspace
3. Create a new web app under App Services (use the advanced option)
4. Set up Vnet
5. Right click the web app and click deploy
6. Overwrite previous deploy if prompted

Refer to AzureWebAppDeploymentSteps.docx for more detailed steps

Redeploy steps: Save changes, and repeat steps 4-5


How the code works:
Created a flask app that renders html from a string
Set a scheduler to run the update html method that calls the original app_monitoringV4 code every 5 minutes

app.py has methods to 
- initialize the html
- set a default html table on initial deployment/access
- update the html with the CheckStatus results
- check which urls are down & send emails


Initial bug of appending table was because the CheckStatus class does not reinstantiate its html
on every test_url call


I have another implementation that was in the works as a workaround to the appending bug mentioned above
This implementation wasn't needed once I discovered the source of the bug, I was able to use the inital implementation
The unused implementation is:
There is a route for the index page which is overwritten on a schedule by the html generated by the CheckStatus method
The testurls method is also scheduled to be called
Currently the update is called every 3 minutes, and the url testing is called every 2 minutes


Emailing multiple recipients does not require a change in code, just append to excel sheet in the same cell seperated by a comma


V1:
- All links work, Archer, Archibus, CIRA, MySSC+, P2P
- Internet images used for lights

V2:
- Email functionality
- Externally configurable timer
- Included Links: ATIP, ATIPPAL

V3:
- Refresh Page based on timer page
- Test Now Button
- Disabled for a minute after click to reduce spam clicking errors
- Still issue if button clicked around the time of timer update which will cause double table
- However that issue will be fixed after the next button click or timer trigger

V4:
- Email can now properly email multiple people
(Issue was that it was set in the "TO" section of the email but wasn't passed in the method)
- Included many more CIO links and emails

To Do for V5:
- Refresh: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16399355/refresh-a-local-web-page-using-python
- Input Fields to add URLs on front end
- Fix P2P DEV & UAT error: Invalid Schema (No connection adapters found) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15115328/python-requests-no-connection-adapters3
